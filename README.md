# Containerising a simple node app from scratch

This is a learning project to become more comfortable with Docker and Kubernetes. 

I'm folowing [some instructions](https://nodejs.org/fr/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/) but also just googling as I go. 

# Setup

_Coming Soon_

# Commands

```bash
docker ps
```

```bash
docker ps -a
```

```bash
docker images
```

```bash
docker logs <containerId>

# example: docker ogs 871
```
